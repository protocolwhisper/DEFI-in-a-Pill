# Introduction

Welcome to DEFI in a Pill! This is a developer resource where DEFI-Complex protocols are broken down with a focus on how it works, the math behind it, and code snippets :)

## Which Protocols are included?

We aim for the big ones like Aave or Uniswap for the first instance, but there are a lot of good protocols out there that are worth reviewing it. But we will be starting with a deep dive into the big ones at the begining.

## Github for snippets and extra content
